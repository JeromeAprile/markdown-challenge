## You can always count on me when...
... it comes to going for a drink with friends. I'm always up for socializing and creating memorable moments together.

## A funny story :

That day, I didn't hear my alarm clock ring, I walked with my socks on the still wet bathroom floor, I arrived late for the first appointment of my day, I forgot my phone at home... Truly the kind of day that makes you want to go back to bed and wait for tomorrow.

When I returned from work, I decided to treat myself with a takeaway pizza for comfort, but I got stuck in traffic on the way back and when I finally arrived home... it was cold (just my luck)!

So, I decided to put the pizza in the oven for a few moments to warm it up and went to take off my jacket. I grabbed my phone that I had forgotten on the table in the morning and checked all the notifications I had received throughout the day, then I got lost scrolling through Instagram (classic).

"Hey, it's funny, it looks like there's smoke in the kitchen, doesn't it?"

Lost in distraction, I had put the pizza in the oven with its cardboard box, and it had caught fire.

My first reflex was to blow on it to try to extinguish the flames.

I finally managed to put it out with a wet towel.

I didn't eat any pizza.

I spent the following week scrubbing every corner of the kitchen that had been stained with soot.

Probably one of the best days of my life.

## TL;DR

"I set fire to a pizza and tried to put out the beginning of the fire by blowing on the flames."
